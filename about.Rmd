title: "About the MitoWomen initiative"
---

We intend to build a broad community, but in case you wonder, this movement was started by [Aurora Gomez-Duran](https://twitter.com/auroradevea) and [Gloria Brea-Calvo](https://twitter.com/gloriabreacalvo) looking for a more diverse and inclusive world.

For more information you can contact us also at mitowomen@gmail.com or [mitowomen](https://twitter.com/mitowomen) in Twitter.

This website is made with [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) and the code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/mitodisease/mitowomen). If you have some basic knowledge of R/Rmarkdown and git/GitHub it should relatively easy to adapt for similar initiatives.
