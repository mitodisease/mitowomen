title: "About the MitoWomen initiative"
---

We are two mito-scientists, who inspired by others such as #500WomenScientist, #WomeninMalaria or #WomeninSoilScience, decided to start a platform to make more visible the women working in the mitochondrial field. 

This database intends not only to create a network for collaboration and support but to boost women representation on editorial boards, as keynote speakers in conferences, in invited special issues, as reviewers, on grant funding panels or as expert researchers for media consultation or interviews.
