We intend to build a broad community, but in case you wonder, this movement was started by [Aurora Gomez-Duran](https://twitter.com/auroradevea) and [Gloria Brea-Calvo](https://twitter.com/gloriabreacalvo) looking for a more diverse and inclusive world.

For more information you can contact us also at mitowomen@gmail.com or [@mitowomen] (https://twitter.com/mitowomen) in Twitter.
