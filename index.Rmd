The Women in Mitochondria initiative aims to make the **women working on mitochondria research more visible**, contributing to accelerate **equality and diversity** in the field. It is inspired by initiatives like [500 Women Scientist](https://500womenscientists.org/), [Women in Malaria](https://womeninmalaria.weebly.com/), [Women in Soil Science](https://franciskadevries.wordpress.com/women-in-soil-science/) or [Women in Microbiology](https://microbiomedigest.com/sample-page/women-in-microbiology-for-keynote-lectures/).

This database intends to create a network for collaboration and support, and to **boost women representation** on editorial boards, as keynote speakers in conferences, in invited special issues, as reviewers, on grant funding panels or as expert researchers for media consultation or interviews.

We are firmly convinced that **diversity positively impacts science and society**. For this reason, we hope not only to give visibility to the women who work in mitochondria but also to be a platform where **mitowomen from all over the world have the opportunity to be represented**.
